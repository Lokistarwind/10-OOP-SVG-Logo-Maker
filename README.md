# 10-OOP-SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description
The purpose of this project is to build an automated svg file type logo maker. It was made to create svg logos with a little customization that can be used for HTML uses. Making the code for it help me understand the concept of using Object Oriented Programming to divide up tasks into classes and create tests in order to see if the code properly works.

## Installation
Once you downloaded the file, open the terminal and cd into the correct directory.
In terminal enter 
npm init -y

Afterwards install inquirer by typing this into the terminal
npm i inquirer@8.2.4
You will also need to install jest so do so by entering
npm i jest

Now you can run the project by typing
node index
Doing so will make the file logo.svg into the directory.

Afterwards you can cd into the lib folder and type
node test
to run shapes.test.js to see that the test code works.

## Usage
You can use the project to see how inquerier runs and see how all the clases work with the main files. Also its a handy tool to make a professional scg logo for personal use.


## Credits
For this project I used code from Challange 9 to make a rough outline and structure of the project. Also I used svg files that were based on the example on the gitlab page. They are in the example folder to figure out the structure of teh HTML code and presentation of the svg logos.
